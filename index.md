# Ciao
I am Angelo, 22 years old, from Olbia, in Italy.
In 2018 I moved to Milan to study Mathematical Engineering at @ Politecnico di Milano. I got my Bachelor of Science Degree with the grade of 110/110 cum laude, the highest distinction awarded. 
I am currently pursuing my MSc degree in Mathematics at @ ETH Zurich, focusing on the area of "Mathematics of Data Science", which involves focusing on Statistics, Probability and Combinatorics, Machine Learning.
At the moment, I am Research Intern at @ ETH AI Center, focusing on problems at the intersection of Differential Privacy and Online Learning. 

In this page I will collect some bits of my academic and job career, and whatever Iâ€™d like to share with the rest of the world.

### News
- June 2022: I started working at @ ETH AI Center!
- June 2022: I finished and submitted my first research paper, titled "Generalization Error Bound via Information-Theoretic Methods and Convex Analysis". I worked under the supervision of Dr. Nikita Zhivotovskiy (now Assistant Professor at @ University of California, Berkeley) and Prof. Dr. Afonso Bandeira (Professor of Mathematics at @ ETH Zurich).
